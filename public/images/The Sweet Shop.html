<h1>SINCE 1927</h1>
When Grandpa Joseph Zaro opened his first bakery in The Bronx  in 1927, a lot was happening in New York City. Babe Ruth was on track to hit a lifetime 714 home runs. The Neil Simon Theatre (called The Alvin then) had just opened on 52nd Street. A lot has changed. But the Zaro family obsession with baking the finest breads and pastries in the city has not. Currently operated by the grandsons and great-grandsons of Joseph and his wife May, our nine stores send our signature black and white bags down sidewalks, over bridges, under streets, through tunnels, up elevators, down stairs, and—at the end of the day—home to millions of New York metro area dwellers. And we do it every New York minute of every New York day.</main>
