<h2>SINCE 1927</h2>
<p>When Juan Mike opened his first bakery in The Bronx  in 2018, a lot was happening in New York City. Jets was on track to lose 70 games in a row. Donald Trump is destorying America. A lot has changed. But the Mike family obsession with baking the finest breads and pastries in the city has not. Currently operated by the grandsons and great-grandsons, our nine stores send our signature black and white bags down sidewalks, over bridges, under streets, through tunnels, up elevators, down stairs, and—at the end of the day—home to millions of New York metro area dwellers. And we do it every New York minute of every New York day.</p>
